# Sales & Marketing — BeautyOps

**Purpose:** Single-source, actionable GTM guide to run pilots, convert to paying accounts, and scale via channels. Keep this doc in repo as the operational playbook for the first 90 days.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- Focus: buy early pilots fast with targeted outbound (GHL agencies & mid-market beauty brands), convert pilots to paid subscriptions, and build case studies that fuel inbound and partner channels.
- North star: demonstrate measurable, repeatable value (GHL tasks executed + SKU uplift) in 6–12 pilots in first 60 days.

---

## 2. ICP & Buyer Personas

- Primary ICPs:
  - **GHL Agencies**: resellable service, fast pilots across multiple clients.
  - **Mid-market Beauty & Specialty Retail Brands**: 10–200 stores, exportable POS CSVs.
- Personas & pain points:
  - **Head of Retail/Field Ops** — needs reliable execution and compliance; wants quick, actionable tasks.
  - **Head of Commercial / Category / eCom** — looks for SKU performance and lift.
  - **Agency AE / Channel Partner** — wants white‑labelable repeatable program.

---

## 3. Value Propositions & Messaging

- Headline: **"Turn store visits, POS and shelf photos into prioritized actions — delivered automatically to GoHighLevel."**
- Messaging by persona:
  - Ops: “Reduce time-to-action — auto-create 3–5 prioritized tasks per store.”
  - Commercial: “Targeted SKU opportunities with measurable +2–5% conversion changes.”
  - Agency: “White-label pilot, new recurring revenue stream, fast time-to-value.”

---

## 4. GTM Motions

1. **Targeted Outbound (High priority)**
   - Use `outreach_sequences.csv` + `outreach_pilot_2-slide.md` as attachment.
   - Focus lists: GHL agencies, mid-market beauty brands, retail ops leads.
2. **Partnerships**
   - GHL partners, POS providers, regional distributors.
3. **Inbound Content**
   - Publish pilot case studies, how‑to guides (visit → task), and SEO content for queries like "store visit automation".
4. **Paid/Retargeting** (phase 2)
   - Case-study-driven ad creatives targeted at retail ops & agencies.

---

## 5. Pilot Offer — Structure & Pricing

- **2‑Week Pilot** (baseline)
  - Scope: 2–5 stores
  - Deliverables: 6–15 visit reports, 1 POS analysis, 3–8 vision snapshots, sample GHL tasks
  - Suggested commercial terms: $2,500 setup OR free w/ reference, then conversion to $149/store/mo or custom enterprise pricing
- **Goals:** generate 3–5 actionable tasks per store; demonstrate SKU lift in targeted SKUs.

---

## 6. Sales Playbook & Process

- **Discovery/Outreach** → 20‑min kickoff → Data request (POS CSV, visit audio/recording, shelf photos) → Execution → Demo & recommendations → Confirm GHL tasks → Close to subscription
- **Objection handling**:
  - Data access concerns: offer secure upload links and an NDA
  - ROI concerns: offer pilot with clear success metrics and refund/discount if no tasks or insights
- **Qualification checklist** (MQL → SQL):
  - POS export available? (Yes/No)
  - # store doors (≥2)?
  - Willingness to provide visit recordings/photos? (Yes/No)
  - GoHighLevel access needed for automated task creation? (Optional)

---

## 7. Outbound & Cadence

- Use existing `outreach_sequences.csv` for templated sequences.
- Suggested cadence: 1‑2 weeks sequence with 4–6 touches (email, LinkedIn, call, voicemail).
- Attachment for first email: `outreach_pilot_2-slide.md` converted to PDF.

---

## 8. Templates (Email + Call)

**Email — First touch**

Subject: Quick 2‑week pilot to drive in‑store SKU wins

Hi [Name],

We run a short, focused 2‑week pilot that delivers store visit reports, one POS analysis, and shelf snapshots — all with prioritized tasks we can push directly into GoHighLevel.

Would you be open to a quick 20‑minute kickoff next week? Reply "Pilot" and we’ll get it scheduled.

Best,
Team BeautyOps

## 9. Demo & Delivery Checklist

- Deliverables: PDF visit reports; single POS analysis PDF; vision snapshot images + tactical notes; GHL tasks loaded into their instance (if access provided)
- Handoff: short summary email + access to Supabase pilot dashboard / Google Sheet with metrics

---

## 10. Pilot Analytics & KPIs

- **Pilot KPIs:** # pilots started, # pilots completed, avg tasks created/store, pilot conversion → paid, SKU conversion delta
- **Tracking:** log pilot metadata in Supabase (pilot id, client, start/end, status, KPIs) or a simple Google Sheet initially

---

## 11. Assets to Build (priority)

1. 2‑slide PDF (done as Markdown; convert to PDF)
2. One-pager case study template
3. HubSpot/Outreach-ready CSV (HubSpot variant of `outreach_sequences.csv`)
4. Demo video (5–7 minutes) + script
5. Pilot SOW & pricing sheet
6. Pilot survey (NPS + qualitative questions)

---

## 12. 90‑Day Timeline (Recommended)

- **0–30 days:** run outbound; secure 2–3 pilots; build delivery templates
- **30–60 days:** complete pilots; capture metrics; publish 1–2 case studies
- **60–90 days:** scale outreach; start paid campaigns & partner onboarding; hire 1 AE/SDR if conversion > target

---

## 13. Roles & Hiring (early hires)

- 0–30 days: Founders + 1 customer success/ops for pilots
- 30–90 days: hire 1 SDR or AE depending on pipeline conversion; contractor for content/case studies

---

## 14. Risk & Mitigation

- **Risk:** Data access friction — _Mitigation_: provide clear instructions, secure upload link, and optional managed collection
- **Risk:** No tangible lift in pilot — _Mitigation_: tightly define success metrics and limit pilot to stores with clear problems to solve

---

## 15. Next Steps (actionable)

- Convert `outreach_pilot_2-slide.md` → PDF and add to repo as `outreach_pilot_2-slide.pdf` (owner: marketing)
- Create HubSpot variant of `outreach_sequences.csv` and import test segment (owner: marketing / ops)
- Start first outbound batch (target: 100 prospects from GHL agencies & mid-market brands) and monitor replies
- Implement minimal pilot dashboard in Supabase to track KPIs (owner: engineering)
